# This repository *EXPERIMENTAL* and not intended for everyday use.

np-build it's a conversion of a bash script for creating hosting environment and wordpress installation on a digital ocean server with VestaCP console.
It's also under heavy development and things may break any moment.

## Before execution

- Install wp-cli
- Install nodejs (apt-get install node)
- 'npm install'

This script is intented to be runned as _root_ for now, which is *VERY* bad.  

### todo

- use npm wp-cli instead of system wp-cli
- Better asyncronous execution
